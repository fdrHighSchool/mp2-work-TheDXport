# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * takes a part of the string starting from index a all the way to the end

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * takes a part of the string starting from index a all the way to b (excludes index b)

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * finds the first instance of str within a string

  * `.equals(str)`
    * compares a string to str within an if statement to check if a specific part of a string is equals to another string; returns a boolean value of true of false.


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * the for loop goes through all the possible indexes within the s variable starting from index 0 until the end of the string, and it increments by one for each iteration int the for loop.
