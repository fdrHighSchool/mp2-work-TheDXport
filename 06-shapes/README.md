#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following output:
```
000111222333444555666777888999
000111222333444555666777888999
000111222333444555666777888999
```
  * 1) Loop 3 times with variable i(the amount of rows)
  * 2) Within that loop, loop another time with variable j, increment by one, print the index j in the for loop three times.


2. Write a plan for the following output:
```

```
  * 1) Loop 5 times (the amount of rows) 
  * 2) Within that loop, loop another time where the variable i starts at 9. Instead of incrementing by one every single time, i should de decrementing by 1 each time. Loop another time with variable j where it loops 5 times and prints out the variable i from the second loop.
